            Self-publishing and self-distributing your music means that you, as
            an artist or as a part of a group of creatives, take full control
            over the song writing, production, release, and distribution of your
            work without relying on traditional publishers or music labels.
            Here&#39;s a technical breakdown of what that entails:
          </p>
          1. Self-Publishing
          <br />
          What is Publishing?
          <br />
          <p className="mb-4">
            Publishing refers to the rights management of your music. When you
            write or compose a song, you own the copyright to that piece of
            music. Copyright ensures that you are paid when your music is used
            commercially, such as when it is streamed, played on the radio, or
            used in TV or film.
          </p>
          2. Self-Distribution
          <br />
          What is Distribution?
          <br />
          <p className="mb-4">
            Distribution is the process of getting your recorded music onto
            various platforms, both digital (streaming services, downloads)
            physical (CDs, vinyl, etc.), or in NFT format.
          </p>
          3. Legal Responsibilities
          <br />
          <ul className="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
            <li>
              Contracts & Licensing: As a self-published and self-distributed
              artist, you must be familiar with basic music contracts, licensing
              agreements, and intellectual property laws.
            </li>
            <li>
              Copyright Registration: Although you automatically own the
              copyright to your music upon creation, registering it with the
              U.S. Copyright Office (or the equivalent in your country) provides
              additional legal protection.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Summary
          <br />
          By self-publishing and self-distributing, you keep all the creative
          and financial control over your music but take on the added
          responsibility of managing rights, royalties, promotion, distribution
          logistics and financial distribution. You need to be well-organized
          and either learn how to handle these aspects, hire professionals or
          use online tools to assist you.
