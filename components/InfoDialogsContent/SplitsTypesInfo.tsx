        <b>
          Copyright in Musical Composition (Publishing Rights or Composition
          Rights):
        </b>{' '}
        Relate to the “song” or underlying composition—the lyrics and melody of
        a song, independent of any particular recording. These rights are
        divided between the <b>songwriter</b> (or composer) and the{' '}
        <b>music publisher.</b> The publisher manages the songwriter’s
        composition by licensing it for use, collecting royalties, and ensuring
        it is properly credited. The key components of publishing rights include{' '}
        <b>performance rights, mechanical rights,</b> and synchronization rights
        (for use in films, TV, etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Copyright in Sound Recordings (MASTER Rights):</b> Pertains to the
        ownership of a particular recording of a performance of a song. Whoever
        owns the master rights controls the use, distribution, reproduction, and
        performance of that specific recording. These rights typically belong to
        the record label or the artist who financed the production of the
        recording, though they can be sold or licensed.
      </li>
    </ol>
    Both rights are crucial for monetizing and legally protecting music. The
    copyright controls the use of a specific recording, while publishing rights
    control the use of the song&#39;s composition.
